About
=====

Lolram is a collection of Python web framework utilities. It is a personal
project, and since it is biased toward my needs, I do not recommend using it
for production services. However, feel free to take portions or fork changes
of the code. Just remember the licensing terms.

Installation
============

Lolram depends on lots of free and open-source packages. I recommend using 
pip, easy_install, or a package manager (apt-get) for installation of packages.
