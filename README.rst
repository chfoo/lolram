About
=====

Lolram is a collection of Python web framework and utilities that powers 
www.torwuf.com.

It is a personal project, and since it is biased toward my needs, it's not 
entirely reliable for production use. However, feel free to take portions or 
fork changes of the code. Just remember the licensing terms.
